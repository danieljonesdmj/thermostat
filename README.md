# Thermostat (9th-13th June)

Week 5 project at Makers Academy, building a Thermostat single page web app in Javascript. 
The goal was to build a thermostat that can increase and decrease the temperature responding to user input.
The thermostat connects with OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display the current temperature for any city requested.
